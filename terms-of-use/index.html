  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p class="date"><strong>Effective Date:</strong> April 1st, 2025</p>

  <p>By accessing or using Noia ("Noia," "Gentle Goal Tracker," "I," "me," or "my") service, website, or any applications (including mobile applications) made available by me (together, the "Service"), however accessed, you agree to be bound by these Terms of Use ("Terms of Use").</p>

  <p>The Service is owned and operated solely by <strong>Natalia Eliseeva</strong>.</p>

  <p>These Terms of Use affect your legal rights and obligations. If you do not agree to be bound by all of these Terms of Use, do not access or use the Service.</p>

  <p>There may be times when I offer a special feature that has its own terms and conditions. In those cases, the specific terms for that feature will apply to the extent they conflict with these Terms of Use.</p>

  <h2>Basic Terms</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>You must be at least 18 years old to use the Service.</li>
    <li>You may not post violent, nude, partially nude, discriminatory, unlawful, infringing, hateful, pornographic, or sexually suggestive photos or other content via the Service.</li>

    <li>You must not solicit, collect, or use other users’ login credentials.</li>
    <li>You must not defame, stalk, bully, harass, threaten, impersonate, or intimidate anyone or post private/confidential info.</li>
    <li>You may not use the Service for illegal or unauthorized purposes.</li>
    <li>You are solely responsible for any content you submit or display on the Service.</li>

  </ul>

  <p>Violation of these Terms may result in termination of your Noia account at my sole discretion.</p>
